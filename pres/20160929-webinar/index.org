* Intro
- A bit about me: co-founder of Sirma Group Holding, Bulgaria's largest software group and parent company of Ontotext
  - 30y in IT: 8 at university, 22 in industry
  - Did plenty of project management, business analysis and data modeling, some big projects too
  - Last 8 years focused on data modeling and integration
  - Last 6 years in paricular, focused on semantic data and semantic integration
- I love to poke in other people's data and get in-depth. So there's a lot about data in these slides
- See [[http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/my/master/index.html][My publications]]: you can sort by type and keyword, full abstracts are available. 
  - I've provided a few references below, but if a topic interests you, please search in the publications
- The shorter version has about 110 slides, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Should take us 1:20h
  - Ask questions at any time in the chat, I'll answer them all at the end
- This longer version has 130 slides, including info about Library metadata and ontologies

** GLAM vs Internet
GLAM, CH, DH?
- *Cultural Heritage* (CH): the sum of our non-economic heritage
  - Obvious implications to economically significant sectors, eg tourism
  - Some say it's the source of all creativity, would you agree?
  - Includes old and new (eg digitally-born), material and immaterial, tangible and intangible, permanent and temporal (eg interactive installations)
- *Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums* (GLAM): sisterhood of institutions that care for our CH, each with its own perspective and priorities
- *Digital Humanities (DH)*: the use of computers in the humanities.
  - Eg some UK universities with DH programs: @KingsDH @UCLDH @DH_OU @CamDigHum

** Google NGrams: Phrases in Books
Search for "library, museum" vs "Google, Facebook, Twitter" in books: the web sites are negligible

** Google NGrams: Two Specific Orgs
Compare two specific orgs: "Facebook" is more popular in recent books, compared to "British Museum" over time
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1320px

** Google Trends: Search Popularity
Web searches over the last 12 years: "Facebook, Google" are much more popular than "library, museum"
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1320px
[[./img/google-search-trends.png]]

** How To Survive in the Internet Age?
Since ancient times GLAMs have been the centers of knowledge and wisdom
- Aren’t Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter and smart-phone apps becoming the new centers of research and culture (or at least popular culture)?
- Will GLAMs fall victims to teenagers with smartphones browsing Facebook? If the library's attitude is "Come search in our OPAC" then *certainly yes*
- How to preserve the role of GLAMs into the new millennium? 
To survive, GLAMs must adopt the internet as their default modus operandi
- Web 1.0: presentation
- Web 2.0: interaction
- Web 3.0 (semantic web): data linking, enriching/disambiguating text using NLP/IE approaches

** Why Linked Open Data (LOD) is Important
- Culture is naturally cross-institutional, cross-border, multilingual, and interlinked
- LOD allows making connections between (and making sense of) the multitude of digitized cultural artifacts available on the net
- LOD enables large-scale Digital Humanities research, collaboration and aggregation; technological renewal of CH institutions
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1263px
[[./img/CH-linking.png]]


* GLAM Content Standards
GLAM data is complex and varied
- Exception is the rule
- Many metadata format variations
- Data comes from a variety of systems
Thus professional organizations have found it useful to define *content standards*
- Describe what data to capture (and sometimes how to go about it)
- Before formalizing how to express it in machine-readable form
Examples are extremely useful for data modelers to decide how to map the data


** Museum Content Standards
[[http://cco.vrafoundation.org/][Cataloging Cultural Objects]]: content standard for art, architecture, museums
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:708px
[[./img/CCO-cover.jpg]]

*** CCO Example: Artwork and Creator Record
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/CCO-example-Marco-Ricci.png]]

*** CCO Example: Hierarchical Link Between 2 Artworks
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/CCO-example-chartres-portal.png]]

*** CCO Example: Creator Extent
How to describe one aspect of the data
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:850px
[[./img/CCO-example-creator-extent.png]]

*** SPECTRUM
#+ATTR_HTML: :style width:150px
[[./img/spectrum-logo.jpg]]
[[http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum][UK Museum Collections Management Standard]] 
- Defines procedures for museums to follow, and the attendant data
- Covers 21 procedures: Pre-entry, Object entry, Loans in, Acquisition, Inventory control, Location and movement control, Transport, Cataloguing, Object condition checking and technical assessment, Conservation and collections care, Risk management, Insurance and indemnity management, Valuation control, Audit, Rights management, Use of collections, Object exit, Loans out, Loss and damage, Deaccession and disposal, Retrospective documentation
- Addresses accreditation

*** SPECTRUM Example: Object Entry
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1300px
[[./img/SPECTRUM-object-entry.png]]


** Archival Content Standards
- ISAD(G): archival materials
- ISAAR(CPF): agents (corporations, people, families)
- ISDF: functions (eg Secretary of some society)
- ISDIAH: archival holding institutions
Image by D.Pitti, 2015
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/ICA-standards-timelines.png]]


** Library Content Standards
- AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2)
- International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD)
- Resource Description and Access (RDA)
Extremely detailed and comprehensive (see RDA later).
But sometimes pay more attention where to put the commas than to:
- Data sharing
- Global availability of resources
- Sharing the cataloging burden

*** FRBR, FRSAD, FRAD 
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), Subject Authority Data (FRSAD), Authority Data (FRAD)
(J.Mitchell, M.Zeng, M.Zumer, 2011)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/FRBR-FRAD-FRSAD.jpg]]

*** FRBR
Starts from user tasks (find, identify, select, obtain, explore).
Introduces the important 4-level WEMI model (relates to Uniform Titles):
- Work: original or derived intellectual work (eg Don Quixote)
- Expression: translation or edition (eg Don Quixote translation to English)
- Manifestation: publisher's work (eg with illustrations, foreword by, compilation...). ISBNs are here
- Item: physical copy: libraries track loan/availability; famous copies (eg Lincoln's Bible); manuscripts are singleton items

*** FRSAD
Anything can be subject (thema), referred to by various names/titles (nomen)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:950px
[[./img/FRSAD.png]]

*** FRBR-LRM
FRBR-Library Reference Model (P.Riva, P.Le Bœuf, M.Žumer, Draft for World-Wide Review 2016-02). Merges the previous standards
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/FRBR-LRM.png]]


* GLAM Metadata Schemas
How many of the standards listed in [[http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/][Seeing Standards: A Visualization of the Metadata Universe]] apply to your work?
(by Jenn Riley, Associate Dean for Digital Initiatives at McGill University Library)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1222px
[[./img/GLAM-seeing-standards.png]]

** Seeing Standards (2)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1320px
[[./img/GLAM-seeing-standards-full.png]]

** XML Schemas
Do you deal with XML? I bet you do
- XML Schema (XSD): most widely used, but most unwieldy
- RelaxNG (RNG): new generation schema language
- RNG Compact (RNC): non-XML notation, most readable. Eg EAD3 is mastered in RNC, then RNG and XSD produced
- Schematron: express rules in XPath that can't be captured in XSD/RNG/RNC (eg cross-field validation)
Tools:
- https://github.com/EHRI/jing-trang/tree/EHRI-176: patch the *jing* RNG validator to emit errors like Schematron (SVRL with XPath error location)
- https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rnc: RNC tools and CH schemas in RNC. Emacs with code highlighting and syntax checking (flycheck)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:600px
[[./img/RNC-flymake.png]]

** Museum Metadata: CDWA
Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA): realization of CCO, 532 "categories" (data elements).
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:800px
[[./img/CDWA-sections.png]]

*** CDWA Lite
XML schema implementing part of CDWA. Moderate complexity, about 300 elements.
Display vs Indexing (structured) elements, eg for Dimension.
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1350px
[[./img/CDWA-data-outline.png]]

*** CONA Schema
Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA): Getty museum data aggregation. Moderate complexity, about 280 elements:
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1350px
[[./img/CONA-data-outline.png]]

*** SPECTRUM XML
[[http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/item/1602-spectrum-4-0-schema][SPECTRUM Schema 4.0b]] has 10 entities and 592 fields, of which 490 are Object (artwork) fields.
I am not aware of any systems producing this.
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1350px
[[./img/SPECTRUM-object-data-outline.png]]

*** LIDO
Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO). 
Evolved from CDWA, museumdat, with inspiration from CIDOC CRM.
(Images by R.Stein and A.Vitzthum, ATHENA workshop, 2010)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/LIDO-data-outline.png]]

*** LIDO Schema
- Complex schema, eg when referring to a related object, you can provide almost as much detail as for the main object.
  Could leverage opportunities for linking more.
- Display vs Indexing (structured) elements: inherited from CDWA
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/LIDO-example.png]]

** Archive Metadata
- EAD: Encoded Archival Description. Describes archival materials (documentary units)
- EAC/CPF: Encoded Archival Context: Corporations, Persons, Families
- EAG: Encoded Archival Guide. Describes institutions

*** Archive Metadata Problems 
Pay a lot of attention to presentation, not enough to linking (difficult to "semanticize"). Emphasis on documents, not historic agents and events
- EAG: So-called "controlled access points" are text, and typically not controlled at all
- EAC: Many institutions don't consider EAC very valuable, and instead put person info in EAD's [[http://eadiva.com/2/bioghist/][bioghist]] element (example below from EADiva)
- EAC: Related persons are names ("strings"), not links ("things")
- EAC: Events include lots of info but only Date is separate field (person names could be tagged but often are not)
- EAC: Family tree modeled as Outline, that's also used for other purposes (just presentation)
#+BEGIN_SRC xml

** Library Metadata: MARC
MARC is 50 years old, unreadable, and doesn't accommodate new FRBR principles. MARC-XML is not much better
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:800px
[[./img/MARC.png]]

*** MARC Must Die
A whole emotional subculture, based on a slogan by Roy Fielding, 2002.
- [[http://marc-must-die.info/][marc-must-die.info]]: "MARC is dead" (is it really?)
- [[http://futurelib.pbworks.com/][FutureLib]]: in-depth discussion wiki
- [[https://www.facebook.com/MARC-must-die-244179532306471/][Facebook group]]
[[http://www.slideshare.net/schambers3/marc-must-die][Presentation]] by Sally Chambers, ELAG 2011
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:700px
[[./img/MARC-must-die.png]]


* GLAM Ontologies
Why do they call conversion to RDF "lifting" and back to some other format "lowering"?
- RDF is a simple abstracted data model
- Doesn't have nesting biases like XML: whether a sub-element is nested or referenced by ID. Has less syntactic idiosyncrasies
- (RDF/XML is awful, but there is Turtle for readability, or JSONLD for programmer convenience)
- The model is self-describing in a distributed way: if a class/property is looked up, should return description and info


** Europeana Data Model
Model used by the Europeana aggregator (53M objects), and adopted by Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)
Based on:
- OAI ORE (Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse & Exchange): organizing object metadata and digital representations (WebResources)
- Dublin Core: descriptive metadata 
- SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System): conceptual objects (concepts, agents, etc)
- CIDOC-CRM inspired: events, some relations between objects
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/Europeana-classes.png]]

*** EDM Semantic Graph
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/graph-LevskiOrdinance.png]]

*** EDM Issues/Considerations
- Criticized that it's not expressive enough. Eg can't capture the specific contribution of an artist to artwork
- Complication: splits info about an object:
  - EDM External (form provider): edm:ProvidedCHO and ore:Aggregation
  - EDM Internal (at Europeana): edm:ProvidedCHO and 2 <ore:Aggregation, ore:Proxy> pairs
- Many providers use the minimal features and make mistakes; Europeana didn't do a lot of validation
  - Old objects retro-converted from ESE are poor (only text), though some enrichments added by Europeana
  - [[http://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-quality-committee][Europeana Data Quality Committee]] formed, to push this strategic point (2015-2020)
Evolving specification (since 2009)
- Currently considering actual implementation of Events
- Extensions for manuscripts, music, fashion, etc


** CIDOC CRM
[[http://cidoc-crm.org/][CIDOC CRM]]: comprehensive reference model used for history, historic events, archaeology, museum data, etc
by CIDOC (ICOM documentation committee).
Standardized as ISO 21127:2014, still evolving.
About 85 classes, fundamental branches: Persistent (endurant) vs Temporal (perdurant), Physical vs Conceptual
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/cidoc_class_hierarchy.jpg]]

*** CIDOC CRM Properties
Classes represent abstract things (eg crm:E24_Physical_Man-Made_Thing), specific things (eg Paintings, Coins) are accommodated with crm:P2_has_type.
135 props (plus their inverses); prop hierarchy (see "- - -" at bottom):
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:850px
[[./img/CIDOC-prop-hierarchy.png]]

*** CIDOC Graphical Examples
- [[http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc_tutorial/][Video Tutorial]] (or [[http://personal.sirma.bg/vladimir/crm-tutorial/][HTML version]] including Kindle)
- [[http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc_graphical_representation_v_5_1/graphical_representaion_5_0_1.html][Graphical Representation]] (or [[http://personal.sirma.bg/vladimir/crm-graphical/][continuous HTML version]] including Kindle): essential to understand how to apply CRM in various situations
- Typical modeling construct *short-cut* (crm:P43_has_dimension) vs *long-path* (eg crm:P39i_was_measured_by/crm:P40_observed_dimension), which allows more details
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1209px
[[./img/cidoc-graphical-measurement.jpg]]


** Web Annotation (Open Annotation, OA)
[[https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/][W3C TR]]: mark, annotate, relate any web resources, eg: Webpage and bookmark, Image and region over it, Document and translation, Paragraph and commentary.
Diagram of [[https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#complete-example][Complete Example]] from spec (using my *rdfpuml*)
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/OA-eg44.png]]

** International Image Interop Framework (IIIF)
Standard API for DeepZoom (hi-res) images. Supported by many servers and viewers. http://iiif.io
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/IIIF-showcase.png]]

*** IIIF Presentation API
Based on OA and SharedCanvas. 
Strong attention to JSONLD representation (convenient for developers).
Allows to assemble manuscripts from pieces, present folios, etc etc.
See [[http://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42][Rob Sanderson presentations]], eg [[http://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42/iiif-and-jsonld-lodlam-training-day][IIIF and JSONLD]]:
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:800px
[[./img/IIIF-sharedCanvas.png]]


** Library Ontologies
War of the Bibliographic Ontologies?
- *BIBO*: used for a long time, pragmaic
- *FRBRer*: pragmatic realization of FRBR, but little uptake (not rich enough?)
- *FRBRoo*: based on CIDOC CRM, perhaps too complex
- *Fabio, Cito, Doco* and friends: modern, includes new features (eg citation intent)
- *BibFrame*: sponsored by LoC, but [[http://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42/linked-data-best-practices-and-bibframe][soundly criticized]] for modeling mistakes
- *RDAregistry.info*: basic FRBR classes, numerous properties for all kinds of things. Used for 100M records at TEL
- *SchemaBibEx* (http://bib.schema.org): steps on a clean model sponsored by the big 4 search engines (Google, MS Bing, Yahoo, Yandex.ru).
  Developed by OCLC.
  May end up being used for 300M records at WorldCat.

*** RDAregistry
Resource Description and Access (RDA). Registry info is well organized
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:900px
[[./img/RDAregistry.png]]

*** RDAregistry Properties
Many props (306 for Work alone), 
for specific purposes (eg "apellee" for court decisions, "granting institution" for academic theses).
Numeric prop names, but lexical (natural language) also supported.
Serves many semantic formats. 
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/RDAregistry-Work.png]]

*** A Taste of FRBRoo
[[http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/edm-frbroo-application-profile][EDM–FRBRoo Application Profile]] Task Force: asked what to add to EDM to better fit FRBRoo.
- TF members developed a number of examples, eg on publications of "Don Quixote" (T.Aalberg, V.Alexiev, J.Walkowska).
EDM variant:

*** FRBR-Inspired
- "FRBR, Before and After" by K.Coyle (ALA 2016) is an in-depth look at FRBR-inspired models/realizations.
- Chapter 10 describes the following ontologies: FRBRer, FRBRcore, FaBiO, <indecs>, BIBFRAME, RDA in RDF, webFRBRer, FRBRoo
- "Mistakes have been made", K.Coyle, SWIB 2015

*** British Library Data Model
Pragmatic data model that reuses several ontologies, and adds own props
#+ATTR_HTML: :class stretch :style width:1200px
[[./img/BL-model-serial.png]]

*** First Library That Runs on RDF
Oslo Public Library (http://data.deichman.no, since 2014) uses Koha open source software, RDF in the core, and [[https://github.com/digibib/marc2rdf][marc2rdf]]/rdf2marc conversions.
Pragmatic data model that reuses several ontologies, and adds own props.
Enables a number of agile apps, eg search related books on Kiosk

** Archival Ontologies
3 attempts to represent EAD as RDF, but IMHO neither is very good.
- Eg "The Semantic Mapping of Archival Metadata to the CIDOC CRM Ontology" (Journal of Archival Organization, 9:174–207, 2011) proposes to represent the EAD levels hierarchy (from Fonds down to Items) as *five* parallel CRM hierarchies
Records in Context (RiC): new upcoming semantic standard by ICA
- Addresses the scope of EAD, EAC, EAG in one framework. 
  Inspired by national standards, FRBR (FRBR-LRM), CIDOC CRM
- [[http://schd.ws/hosted_files/archives2015/c7/session109.Rubinstein.pdf][Progress report]] (2015), [[http://lists.village.virginia.edu/mailman/listinfo/ica-egad-ric][Mlist for comments]]
- [[http://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/RiC-CM-0.1.pdf][Conceptual Model]] 1.0 (Sep 2016): Document key components of archival description, properties of each, relations between them
- Ontology: after finalizing the Conceptual Model, Expressed in OWL, will include semantic mapping to similar concepts developed by related communities

* GLAM LOD Datasets (LODLAM)
- Some established thesauri and gazetteers as LOD, some are interconnected: DBPedia; Wikidata, VIAF, FAST, ULAN; GeoNames, Pleiades, TGN; LCSH, AAT, IconClass, Joconde, SVCN, Wordnet, etc.
- Not shown: large collection LODs like: Europeana (EDM), British Museum (CIDOC CRM), YCBA (CIDOC CRM), Rijksmuseum (EDM)

** Global Authority Control
- 201307 [[https://wikimania2013.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Authority_Addicts:_The_New_Frontier_of_Authority_Control_on_Wikidata][Authority Addicts: The New Frontier of Authority Control on Wikidata]], Wikimania 2013
- 201501 [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Authority_control][Wikidata Project Authority Control]] (initiated by Ontotext)
- 201503 [[http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/CH-names/README.html][Name Data Sources for Semantic Enrichment]] study for Europeana of datasets including Person/Organization names. Conclusions:
  - The best datasets to use for name enrichment are VIAF and Wikidata
  - There are few name forms in common between the "library-tradition" datasets (dominated by VIAF) and the "LOD-tradition datasets" (dominated by Wikidata)
  - VIAF has more name variations and permutations, Wikidata has more multilingual names (translations)
  - VIAF is much bigger: 35M persons/orgs. Wikidata has 2.7M persons and maybe 1M orgs
  - Only 0.5M of Wikidata persons/orgs are coreferenced to VIAF, with maybe another 0.5M coreferenced to other datasets, either VIAF-constituent (eg GND) or non-constituent (eg RKDartists)
  - A lot can be gained by leveraging coreferencing across VIAF and Wikidata
  - Wikidata has great tools for crowd-sourced coreferencing

*** Names of Lucas Cranach

* LODLAM Projects
GLAM and DH projects present a bewildering variety, eg
- Publishing Vocabularies/Thesauri as LOD
- Publishing Museum collections and National Bibliographies as LOD
- Enrichment of GLAM metadata with relevant thesauri, semantic and faceted search
- Study of artistic influence over time and space
- Literary traditions, parallel editions
- Poetic repertories
- Studying manuscripts, stematology (manuscript derivation)
- Historiography 
- Studying charters, prosopography ("micro biographies").

** British Museum (BM) and YCBA LOD
- GraphDB runs the BM SPARQL endpoint. One of the biggest CH RDF collections (917M triples)
- As part of RS, developed mapping of BM data (2M objects) with BM, using CIDOC CRM
- This mapping was followed by the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA)
- [[https://confluence.ontotext.com/display/ResearchSpace/BM%2BMapping][Mapping Documentation]]: very comprehensive but is monolithic and has imprecisions. Includes the (in)famous diagram

*** GLAMs Working With Wikidata
Why should GLAMs bother about Wikidata? Because it gives an excellent way to connect and expose your collection data to a multilingual audience
- [[http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/europeana_wikimedia_taskforce_report_2015.pdf][Europeana Wikimedia Taskforce report]]: 
  - Recommendation 1: For every Europeana project, considering the possible benefits of a Wikimedia component should be default behavior
  - Recommendation 7: Make Wikidata a central element of Europeana's "portal to platform" strategy
  - Recommendation 8: Europeana should continue to invest in technology that improves the interoperability between GLAMs and Wikimedia platforms
- [[http://www.slideshare.net/valexiev1/glams-working-with-wikidata][GLAMs Working with Wikidata]]: easily add content about a colorful tradition "blessing of the baskets" ("swiecenie koszyczek" or just "Święconka" in Polish). With proper cats: when we merge them across languages (pl, en, de), we discover the content is about Food and Drink, Easter, and a Polish tradition

** European Holocaust Research Infrastructure
EHRI is a large-scale EU project that involves 23 Holocaust archives (Europe, Israel and the US), DH and IT organizations.
- In its first phase (2011-2015) it aggregated archival descriptions and materials on a large scale and built a Virtual Research Environment (portal) for Holocaust researchers based on a graph database. 
- In its second phase (2015-2019), EHRI2 seeks to enhance the gathered materials using semantic approaches: enrichment, coreferencing, interlinking. Semantic integration involves Four of the 14 EHRI2 work packages and helps integrate databases, free text, and metadata to interconnect historical entities (people, organizations, places, historic events)  and create networks.
